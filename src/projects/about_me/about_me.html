        <h2>What I did Over Break:</h2>
        <p>Over the Christmas break, I drove to Texas. I went to <strong>Amarillo</strong> to help a friend move
            and then went to <strong>Fort Worth</strong> to adopt a dog from an animal shelter.<br> The dog's name is
            Willow.
            She is just over a year old. The shelter named her but my husband and I decided to keep the name.<br>
            She is a mix of Catahoula Leopard Dog, German Shepard, Australian Cattle Dog, and Great Pyrenees.
